⚛️ What is React.js?

React is a popular JavaScript library used to build fast, interactive, and scalable user interfaces, 
especially for single-page applications (SPAs).

✅ Component-Based Architecture

👉 React is a component-based JavaScript library used to build reusable UI elements and efficiently 
update the DOM using a Virtual DOM for high performance.

Used by top companies like:
Netflix
Airbnb
Uber

🧠 What is DOM First?
DOM (Document Object Model) is the tree structure created by the browser when a webpage loads.
HTML
 ├── Head
 └── Body
      ├── h1
      └── button

Updating the Real DOM is slow because the browser must:
Recalculate styles
Repaint layout
Re-render the UI


Virtual DOM

Virtual DOM uses a diffing algorithm to compare UI changes in memory before updating the real DOM, 
reducing expensive operations and improving rendering performance

🚀 How Virtual DOM Works (Step-by-Step)

👉 Step 1 — Initial Render

React creates a Virtual DOM copy of the UI.

👉 Step 2 — State Change

When data changes (like clicking a button), React:

👉 Builds a new Virtual DOM

👉 Step 3 — Diffing Algorithm

React compares:

👉 Old Virtual DOM vs New Virtual DOM

This process is called diffing.

👉 Step 4 — Efficient Update

React updates ONLY the changed nodes in the Real DOM.

🔥 Result → Faster apps.


Key Features of React

👉 Component-Based Architecture
👉 Virtual DOM
👉 JSX
👉 Hooks
👉 One-Way Data Flow

4️⃣ Reconciliation – Finding What Changed

Why Use React?,

React is used to build fast, scalable, and high-performance user interfaces using 
reusable components and a Virtual DOM,
 making development more efficient and maintainable.

  How React Works Internally,

  When state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM, compares it with the 
  previous one using a diffing algorithm, 
  and updates only the changed elements through reconciliation, resulting in high performance.”


  3️⃣ Fiber Architecture (Brain of React)

React uses an internal engine called React Fiber to:
✔ Break rendering into small units
✔ Prioritize important UI updates
✔ Pause and resume work


🧚‍♂️ React Component Lifecycle (Internal Stages)

React lifecycle means how a component is mounted, updated, and removed from the DOM.

Lifecycle Phases (Class Components)
Phase	What happens
Mounting	Component is created & added to DOM
Updating	Component re-renders due to props/state change
Unmounting	Component is destroyed (removed from DOM)
Lifecycle Flow
Mounting → Updating → Unmounting

Lifecycle Methods (Class Components)
Phase	Methods
Mounting	constructor → render → componentDidMount
Updating	render → componentDidUpdate
Unmounting	componentWillUnmount

1. React Fundamentals
JSX (JavaScript XML)

JSX is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript. Example: const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;

Components

Functional Components: Simple JavaScript functions that return JSX
Class Components: ES6 classes with render method (legacy approach)

Props (Properties)

Props pass data from parent to child components, like function parameters. They're read-only.

State

State manages data that changes over time within a component
Using useState hook in functional components
this.state in class components

1. node_modules/ 📦
What is it?

A folder containing ALL the dependencies (libraries/packages) your project needs
Created automatically when you run npm install or yarn install



2. package.json 📋
What is it?
The heart of your Node.js/React project - a configuration file that contains metadata about your project.

Key Sections Explained:
a) Basic Info:

name: Project name (lowercase, no spaces)
version: Project version (follows semantic versioning)
private: If true, prevents accidental publishing to npm

b) dependencies:
Packages required for production (when app runs)

react: Core React library
react-dom: React rendering for web
axios: HTTP client for API calls

c) devDependencies:
Packages only needed during development (testing, linting, building)

eslint: Code quality checker
@testing-library/react: Testing tools

d) scripts:
Custom commands you can run

4. public/index.html 🌐
The single HTML file for your React app (Single Page Application)

Key Point: React injects your entire app into <div id="root"></div>

5. src/index.js ⚙️
The entry point of your React application

6. src/App.js 🎯
Your main component - the root of your component tree

What is package-lock.json?
package-lock.json is an automatically 
generated file that records the exact version of every package installed in your project,
 including all nested dependencies. 
It acts as a snapshot of your entire dependency tree.
